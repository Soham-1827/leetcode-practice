You are given an array nums consisting of n prime integers.

You need to construct an array ans of length n, such that, for each index i, the bitwise OR of ans[i] and ans[i] + 1 is equal to nums[i], i.e. ans[i] OR (ans[i] + 1) == nums[i].

Additionally, you must minimize each value of ans[i] in the resulting array.

If it is not possible to find such a value for ans[i] that satisfies the condition, then set ans[i] = -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,5,7]

Output: [-1,1,4,3]

Explanation:

For i = 0, as there is no value for ans[0] that satisfies ans[0] OR (ans[0] + 1) = 2, so ans[0] = -1.
For i = 1, the smallest ans[1] that satisfies ans[1] OR (ans[1] + 1) = 3 is 1, because 1 OR (1 + 1) = 3.
For i = 2, the smallest ans[2] that satisfies ans[2] OR (ans[2] + 1) = 5 is 4, because 4 OR (4 + 1) = 5.
For i = 3, the smallest ans[3] that satisfies ans[3] OR (ans[3] + 1) = 7 is 3, because 3 OR (3 + 1) = 7.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [11,13,31]

Output: [9,12,15]

Explanation:

For i = 0, the smallest ans[0] that satisfies ans[0] OR (ans[0] + 1) = 11 is 9, because 9 OR (9 + 1) = 11.
For i = 1, the smallest ans[1] that satisfies ans[1] OR (ans[1] + 1) = 13 is 12, because 12 OR (12 + 1) = 13.
For i = 2, the smallest ans[2] that satisfies ans[2] OR (ans[2] + 1) = 31 is 15, because 15 OR (15 + 1) = 31.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
2 <= nums[i] <= 1000
nums[i] is a prime number.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> minBitwiseArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> res;
        for(auto& n : nums){
            if(n & 1){
                auto z = ((n + 1) & ~n) >> 1;
                res.push_back(n & ~z);
            }
            else{
                res.push_back(-1);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};


Step 1: Understanding OR of Consecutive Numbers
When we compute ans OR (ans + 1), what happens?
Adding 1 to any number flips the rightmost 0-bit to 1 and turns all trailing 1s to 0s.
Example: ans = 5
ans     = 101
ans + 1 = 110
─────────────
OR      = 111 = 7
Example: ans = 3
ans     = 011
ans + 1 = 100
─────────────
OR      = 111 = 7
Example: ans = 9
ans     = 1001
ans + 1 = 1010
──────────────
OR      = 1011 = 11
Key observation: The OR operation combines the bits from both numbers, essentially "filling in" the bits.

Step 2: Why Even Numbers Are Impossible
For any ans:

Either ans has last bit = 0 and ans + 1 has last bit = 1
Or ans has last bit = 1 and ans + 1 has last bit = 0

One of the two consecutive numbers always has last bit = 1.
Therefore: ans OR (ans + 1) always has last bit = 1
This means the result is always odd.
Conclusion: If n is even, return -1.
cppif(n & 1){
    // n is odd, solution exists
}
else{
    res.push_back(-1);  // n is even, impossible
}
```

## Step 3: Finding the Pattern

Let's look at several examples to find a pattern:

| n (decimal) | n (binary) | ans (decimal) | ans (binary) | Verification |
|-------------|------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| 3 | 011 | 1 | 001 | 1 OR 2 = 01 OR 10 = 11 = 3 ✓ |
| 5 | 101 | 4 | 100 | 4 OR 5 = 100 OR 101 = 101 = 5 ✓ |
| 7 | 111 | 3 | 011 | 3 OR 4 = 011 OR 100 = 111 = 7 ✓ |
| 11 | 1011 | 9 | 1001 | 9 OR 10 = 1001 OR 1010 = 1011 = 11 ✓ |
| 13 | 1101 | 12 | 1100 | 12 OR 13 = 1100 OR 1101 = 1101 = 13 ✓ |
| 31 | 11111 | 15 | 01111 | 15 OR 16 = 01111 OR 10000 = 11111 = 31 ✓ |

**Pattern discovered:** 

We need to find the **rightmost consecutive sequence of 1s** in `n` and turn off the **last bit of that sequence**.
```
n = 7   = 111    → turn off bit at position 2 → 011 = 3
n = 11  = 1011   → turn off bit at position 1 → 1001 = 9
n = 13  = 1101   → turn off bit at position 2 → 1100 = 12
n = 31  = 11111  → turn off bit at position 4 → 01111 = 15

Step 4: The Algorithm
To find which bit to turn off, we need to locate the first 0-bit from the right (the bit just after the trailing 1s).
Part A: Find the lowest 0-bit in n
cpp(n + 1) & ~n
```

**How this works:**

| Expression | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| `n + 1` | Flips the lowest 0-bit to 1, and all trailing 1s become 0 |
| `~n` | Inverts all bits of n |
| `(n + 1) & ~n` | Only the lowest 0-bit position remains as 1 |

**Example with n = 11 (binary: 1011):**
```
n       = 1011
n + 1   = 1100
~n      = 0100
─────────────────
(n+1) & ~n = 0100   ← This is the lowest 0-bit position (bit 2)
```

**Example with n = 7 (binary: 0111):**
```
n       = 0111
n + 1   = 1000
~n      = 1000
─────────────────
(n+1) & ~n = 1000   ← This is the lowest 0-bit position (bit 3)
Part B: Shift right by 1 to get the bit we want to clear
cppz = ((n + 1) & ~n) >> 1
```

We shift right by 1 because we want to clear the bit **just before** the lowest 0-bit (the highest bit in the trailing 1s sequence).

**Example with n = 11:**
```
(n + 1) & ~n = 0100
z = 0100 >> 1 = 0010   ← This is the bit we want to turn off
```

**Example with n = 7:**
```
(n + 1) & ~n = 1000
z = 1000 >> 1 = 0100   ← This is the bit we want to turn off
Part C: Clear that bit from n
cppans = n & ~z
```

**How this works:**

| Expression | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| `~z` | All bits are 1 except the bit we want to clear |
| `n & ~z` | Keeps all bits of n except clears the z bit |

**Example with n = 11, z = 2:**
```
n  = 1011
~z = 1101
───────────
n & ~z = 1001 = 9   ← This is our answer!
```

**Example with n = 7, z = 4:**
```
n  = 0111
~z = 1011
───────────
n & ~z = 0011 = 3   ← This is our answer!
