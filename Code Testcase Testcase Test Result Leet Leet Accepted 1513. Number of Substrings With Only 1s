Given a binary string s, return the number of substrings with all characters 1's. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "0110111"
Output: 9
Explanation: There are 9 substring in total with only 1's characters.
"1" -> 5 times.
"11" -> 3 times.
"111" -> 1 time.
Example 2:

Input: s = "101"
Output: 2
Explanation: Substring "1" is shown 2 times in s.
Example 3:

Input: s = "111111"
Output: 21
Explanation: Each substring contains only 1's characters.


How to solve:-
Before we hit a zero, the substring with consecutive number of 1's we just do, n(n+1)/2; and add it to the total.

class Solution {
public:
    int numSub(string s) {
        int cnt = 0;
        long long total = 0;
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;


        for(char a : s){
            if(a == '1'){
                cnt++;
            }
            else{
                
                if(cnt > 0){
                    total = (total + ((long long)cnt * (cnt + 1)) / 2) % mod;
                }
                cnt = 0;
            }
        }
        
        if(cnt > 0){
           total = (total + ((long long)cnt * (cnt + 1)) / 2) % mod;
        }
        return total;
    }
};
