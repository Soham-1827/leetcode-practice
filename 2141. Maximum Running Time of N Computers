You have n computers. You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed integer array batteries where the ith battery can run a computer for batteries[i] minutes. You are interested in running all n computers simultaneously using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert at most one battery into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery any number of times. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.

Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

Return the maximum number of minutes you can run all the n computers simultaneously.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 2, batteries = [3,3,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 1 into the second computer.
After two minutes, remove battery 1 from the second computer and insert battery 2 instead. Note that battery 1 can still run for one minute.
At the end of the third minute, battery 0 is drained, and you need to remove it from the first computer and insert battery 1 instead.
By the end of the fourth minute, battery 1 is also drained, and the first computer is no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 4 minutes, so we return 4.

Example 2:


Input: n = 2, batteries = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 2 into the second computer. 
After one minute, battery 0 and battery 2 are drained so you need to remove them and insert battery 1 into the first computer and battery 3 into the second computer. 
After another minute, battery 1 and battery 3 are also drained so the first and second computers are no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 2 minutes, so we return 2.

Understanding the Binary Search Approach - Simplified
The Core Problem
We have n computers and some batteries. We want to run all computers at the same time for as long as possible.

Why Binary Search?
Instead of figuring out how to swap batteries optimally, we flip the question:

"If I want to run all computers for exactly T minutes, is it possible?"

If we can answer YES/NO quickly, we can binary search to find the maximum T.

The Simple Feasibility Check
Think of it like filling buckets with water:
n computers = n buckets
Each bucket needs T liters (minutes) of water (power)
Total water needed = n × T
Now, each battery is like a water container:

If a battery has more than T power → we can only pour T into one bucket (excess is wasted)
If a battery has less than T power → we pour everything (by swapping between computers)

Example Visualization
Target time T = 4, n = 2 computers

Battery powers: [3, 3, 3]

Computer 1: [====] needs 4 minutes
Computer 2: [====] needs 4 minutes
            ─────────────────────
Total needed: 8 minutes

Battery contributions (each capped at T=4):
  Battery 0: min(3, 4) = 3 ✓
  Battery 1: min(3, 4) = 3 ✓
  Battery 2: min(3, 4) = 3 ✓
             ─────────────────
Total available: 9 minutes

9 >= 8? YES! → T=4 is achievable

Why Capping at T Works
Imagine T = 4 and you have a battery with power = 10.

One computer only needs 4 minutes of power
You can't use the extra 6 on the same computer (it only runs for 4 mins total)
You could swap it to another computer, but that computer also only needs 4

So effectively, no battery can contribute more than T to the total runtime.

Binary Search Logic
Total power = sum of all batteries

Minimum possible answer = 1
Maximum possible answer = Total power / n  (perfect distribution)
We search between these bounds:
[1] -------- [answer] -------- [total/n]
     ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓    ✓      ✗ ✗ ✗ ✗
     
All T values to the LEFT of answer → achievable
All T values to the RIGHT of answer → not achievable


Code:- 
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxRunTime(int n, vector<int>& batteries) {
        long long sum = reduce(batteries.begin(), batteries.end(), 0LL);
        long long left = 1, right = sum/n;

        while(left < right){
            long long mid = left + (right - left + 1)/2;

            long long usable = 0;
            for(int b : batteries){
                usable += min((long long)b ,mid);
            }

            if(usable >= (long long)n * mid){
                left = mid;
            }else{
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
};
