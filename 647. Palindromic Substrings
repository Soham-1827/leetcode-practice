Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of lowercase English letters.


class Solution {
public:
    int countSubstrings(string s) {
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            res += count_palindrome(s, i, i);
            res += count_palindrome(s, i, i + 1);
        }

        return res;        
    }

private:
    int count_palindrome(string s, int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s[left] == s[right]) {
            count++;
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return count;
    }

};


This function expands around the center to count palindromes.

Parameters:
s: the original string.
left, right: indices from which to start checking for palindromes.
How it works:
It checks if s[left] == s[right] — if they match, it's a palindrome (or a part of one).
It expands outward by decreasing left and increasing right.
It keeps counting until it can no longer expand (either characters don't match or goes out of bounds).
✅ This is the core logic to detect all palindromes centered at given indices.
