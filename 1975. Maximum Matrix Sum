You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:

Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.
Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.

Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

 

Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can follow the following steps to reach sum equals 4:
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first row by -1.
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first column by -1.
Example 2:


Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3],[1,2,3]]
Output: 16
Explanation: We can follow the following step to reach sum equals 16:
- Multiply the 2 last elements in the second row by -1.



Think about number of negatives in total matrix
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxMatrixSum(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        long long sum = 0;
        int negative = 0;

        int minimum = INT_MAX;
        for(auto const& mat : matrix){
            for(int i = 0; i < mat.size(); i++){
                minimum = min(minimum, abs(mat[i]));
                sum = sum + abs(mat[i]);
                if(mat[i] < 0){
                    negative++;
                }
            }
        }
        cout << minimum << negative<<endl;
        if(negative % 2 != 0){
            sum = sum - 2 * minimum;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
