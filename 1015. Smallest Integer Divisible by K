Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
Example 2:

Input: k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
Example 3:

Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 105

Intuition:-
Problem with Your Code
When i gets large, pow(10, i) and num will overflow:

i = 10: pow(10, 10) = 10,000,000,000 (exceeds int max of ~2.1 billion)
Building the actual repunit 111111111... will overflow even faster
Why Use Modular Arithmetic?
Instead of building the full number, we only track the remainder:
Mathematical Property:
(a×10+1)mod  k=((amod  k)×10+1)mod  k(a \times 10 + 1) \mod k = ((a \mod k) \times 10 + 1) \mod k(a×10+1)modk=((amodk)×10+1)modk

class Solution {
public:
    int smallestRepunitDivByK(int k) {
        int num = 1;
        int i = 1;
        
        if(k % 2 == 0 || k % 5 == 0 || k % 10 == 0){
            return -1;
        }
        int remainder = 0;

        for(int length = 1; length <= k; length++){
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % k;

            if(remainder == 0){
                return length;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
